# Agentic CAD Suite Experiment, ARE WE COOKED?

## Overview

This project is an experiment in using agentic AI editors to design and build a parametric CAD application with the complexity and interactivity of modern CAD software.

The intent is not necessarily to create a production-ready CAD application, but to test agentic systems on a difficult problem to evaluate their abilities.

## Method

The project follows a strict **end-user–only evaluation model**:

- The human operator does not read, write, or modify source code
- All evaluation is based on observable behavior and user experience
- The agent receives detailed product and behavior specifications, not implementation instructions
